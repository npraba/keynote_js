# keynote_js
Automating slide generation using JavaScript in MacOS.


## Execution

The `example.js` file can be executed to generate a sample *.key* file in the `res` folder using the following steps.

1. Clone/download the repository locally
2. Open Terminal in the folder `keynote_js`
3. Execute the command `osascript example.js`

> **Note**: MacOS might require *Terminal* to allow access to control *Keynote*. This has to be allowed for the script to work.


## Requirements

- MacOS Yosemite or later.
